    <h2>
        What Is Croissant made of?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Croissant dough begins with butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk.
        <br /> Unlike most yeasted doughs that require warm
        liquid to activate the yeast, you're going to use cold milk.
        <br/>The yeast will work its magic later on in the recipe. In
        the beginning steps of croissants, the dough should always be cold.
